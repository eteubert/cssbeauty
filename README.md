What it does
============

* adds empty line between rules
* indents properties by 4 spaces
* adds space after colon
* adds space after selectors
* replace "0&lt;unit>" with "0"
* removes rules without properties
* strips all comments

For the future and beyond
=========================

* make features optional
* user defined indention (spaces & tabs)
* sort properties (positioning first, then width, height, etc. ... something like that)
* provide option to expand CSS3 stuff to all-browser-compatible ruleset
